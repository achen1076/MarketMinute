              Staying informed about your portfolio shouldn't feel like a
              full-time job. Yet every day, investors face the same challenges:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
              <li>Jumping between 5+ websites to track news and prices</li>
              <li>
                Sifting through hundreds of headlines to find what matters
              </li>
              <li>Missing critical events that move your stocks</li>
              <li>
                Spending 30+ minutes just to understand what happened today
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="pt-2">
              Professional traders have Bloomberg terminals and research teams.

              Instead of chasing news across the internet, AI reads hundreds of

              <em> why</em> your stocks moved today.

          <div className="space-y-3 text-muted-foreground">
            <p>
              MarketMinute was born from personal frustration. Like many retail
              investors, we were tired of:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
              <li>Opening 10 browser tabs every morning to catch up</li>
              <li>
                Paying $100/month or more for tools designed for day traders
              </li>
              <li>Getting notifications for stocks we don't even own</li>
              <li>
                Reading AI summaries with no news or facts to back them up
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="pt-2">
              We wanted something simple:{" "}
              <strong>
                a personalized morning brief for our actual watchlist.
              </strong>{" "}
              Nothing more, nothing less.
            </p>
            <p>
              So we built it. And now we're sharing it with investors who feel
              the same way.

            <p>
              I'm a developer who loves building tools that make complex
              information feel effortless. I've spent years investing, tracking
              markets, and creating systems that help explain why things move,
              not just what happened.
            </p>

            <p>
              MarketMinute started because I was tired of hopping between
              websites every morning, scrolling through endless headlines, and
              still not knowing why my watchlist moved. Most tools were built
              for day traders, overloaded with noise, or too generic to be
              useful for most investors.
            </p>

            <p>
              So I built a dashboard for myself: one place tailored to my own
              watchlist, powered by AI summaries that cut through noise and
              focus on what matters. Now I'm sharing it with anyone who wants
              the same clarity and simplicity.
            </p>

              I built MarketMinute for people who want to watch the market, but
              dont have enough time.
